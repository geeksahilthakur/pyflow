# pyflow: Python Flowchart Generator

## About This Project

pyflow is a powerful and intuitive web application designed to simplify the understanding of complex Python programs through visual representation. By generating interactive flowcharts from Python code, pyflow helps developers, students, and educators to:

- Visualize program logic and flow
- Understand complex algorithms at a glance
- Enhance code documentation and presentation
- Facilitate easier debugging and code review processes

Our goal is to bridge the gap between textual code and visual comprehension, making it easier for everyone to grasp the essence of Python programs quickly and efficiently.

## Features

- **Code to Flowchart Conversion**: Instantly transform Python code into clear, interactive flowcharts.
- **Interactive Visualization**: Zoom, pan, and explore your flowcharts for detailed analysis.
- **Algorithm Breakdown**: View a step-by-step breakdown of your code's logic.
- **Export Functionality**: Download your flowcharts as high-quality PNG images for use in documentation or presentations.
- **Responsive Design**: Enjoy a seamless experience across desktop and mobile devices.

## How It Works

1. **Input**: Users paste their Python code into the provided text area.
2. **Processing**: Our backend analyzes the code structure and logic.
3. **Visualization**: An interactive flowchart is generated using D3.js.
4. **Exploration**: Users can interact with the flowchart, zooming and panning as needed.
5. **Export**: The flowchart can be downloaded as a PNG image with a watermark.
